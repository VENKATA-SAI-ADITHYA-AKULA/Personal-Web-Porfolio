# Personal-Web-Porfolio

For my Personal Portfolio project, I crafted an elegant and visually appealing website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio showcases my skills and projects, providing a comprehensive overview of my expertise and accomplishments. By deploying the portfolio on GitHub, I ensured easy access and visibility, allowing potential employers and collaborators to explore my work. This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web development and my ability to create professional and engaging online presentations.
